# From template to robot

The target of this directory is to provide individuals who have no experience programming a robot a way to walk through
the steps required to make a functional robot from scratch. There's also a (somewhat) brief overview of some 
basic programming knowledge needed before following the rest of the tutorial.

I would see [this file](BASICS.md) and see if you understand the concepts discussed in there before continuing on to
the [rest of the tutorial](CODING.md).
